        <p>Hi there! My name is <span>Rixie Red Castro</span>, and I'm from the Philippines. I love to play video games and consoles. I've been married since 2019; I have one child, work as a virtual assistant during the day, and am a father in the morning. I attended BYU because it allowed me to study whenever it was convenient for me. I also belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Later Day Saints; I served on mission from 2016 to 2018 and currently serve as High Counselor for our stake. </p>
