    so I decide to work and study at the same time while enjoying with my family my job now is working as a freelancer partime and work at morning as delivery rider,
    for 9 hours the rest of my time because one job is not enough for my family daily live so I take another partime ,
    I'm persuing this carrer will help me to support my family, great thing In BYU online I was able to study flexitime since I am verry busy,
    becasue as a freelance I already notice that web design and a programer can do work from home set up and also can help me to find multiple jobs available,
    grateful for this opportunities and also being a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints,
